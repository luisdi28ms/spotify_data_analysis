# **Spotify Exploratory Data Analysis**
EDA of my personal music taste and tracks analysis available at Spotify's API. Powered by Google Data Analytics certificate.

The following steps are from the **Google Data Analytics certificate**, I will be answering the questions to guide the development of this project.

### **Ask**

1.  **What topic are you exploring?**

    For this project I will be exploring the music industry and the main areas that I enjoy about it. My purpose is to deeply understand my music taste and what components are present in the songs that I like so much.

2. **What is the problem you are trying to solve?**

    My main problem is that I have identified all these songs and genres that I listen to for entertaiment or that get me in a good mood but I can't really tell why. With this exploration, I am planning to unravel my music taste, through analyzing data. I'll be able to understand and identify key elements present on each of these songs that made them part of my music library.

    Also, once I go through all this process, I'll help other friends or folks understand their own music taste with the help of a pipeline, where you input your favorite songs to receive interisting insights about your track and artist choices.

3. **What metrics will you use to measure your data to achieve your objective?**

    * Completeness: All of the songs in my music library should be considered for this analysis and each data point should have a value on each of the different variables being considered.

    * Validity: The values in each of the variables will be checked to confirm they make sense. I won't be able to arrive at solid conclusions without validating data with actual listening experience.

    * Consistency: The data needs to be consistent everytime you input a specific group of songs, the insights or conclusions obtained as a result will be the same. Overtime, the only changes that can occur are new songs ranked differently accross variables but a specific song will always report the same values on each of the metrics.

4. **Who are the stakeholders?**

    The main stakeholder of this project is me. I get to decide how to process my own data, learn about my music taste and how it may be compared to others.

5. **Who is your audience for this analysis and how does this affect your analysis process and presentation?**

    My audience is me and my friends that might be interested in learning about their music taste. This affects my process and presentation by making it not only about myself and statistical knowledge but also about ordinary people that don't care much about the numbers and want to read about actual insights and visualize how all this translates into the music they like.

6. **How will this data help your stakeholders make decisions?**

    The stakeholder (me) will be able to use this data to better understand what songs I like and will be able to run specific personalize searches on artists or albums to come up with track recommendations without even listening to the songs.
