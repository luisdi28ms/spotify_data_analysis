EDA of my personal music taste and tracks analysis available at Spotify's API. Powered by Google Data Analytics certificate.

The following steps are from the **Google Data Analytics certificate**, I will be answering the questions to guide de development of this project.

## **Ask**

1.  What topic are you exploring?

For this project I will be exploring the music industry and the main areas that I enjoy about it. My purpose is to deeply understand my music taste and what components are present in the songs that I like so much.

2. What is the problem you are trying to solve?

My main problem is that I have identified all these songs and genres that I listen to for entertaiment or that get me in a good mood but I can't really tell why. With this exploration, I am planning to unravel my music taste, through analyzing data. I'll be able to understand and identify key elements present on each of these songs that made them part of my music library.

Also, once I go through all this process, I'll help other friends or folks understand their own music taste with the help of a pipeline, where you input your favorite songs to receive interisting insights about your track and genre choices.

3. What metrics will you use to measure your data to achieve your objective?
